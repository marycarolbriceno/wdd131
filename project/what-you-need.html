                <h2>They need attention</h2>
                <p>
                    Your pet needs quality time. Interacting and playing with them is essential for their emotional
                    well-being.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Adopting a pet is a <strong>long-term commitment</strong>. Pets live an average of 10 to 20 years,
                    depending on the animal. This is crucial to remember when deciding to adopt.
